# Weather Data Analysis & Linear Regression

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression modeling on weather datasets from major global cities. The analysis covers data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and predictive modeling. 

This work has been done as part of the Intelligence Internship program.

## Contents

- **Exercises - Week 1.ipynb**: Introductory data analysis exercises.
- **Exercises - Week 2.ipynb**: Intermediate EDA and visualization tasks.
- **Exercises - Week 3.ipynb**: Advanced analysis and modeling.
- **Homework - Week 2.ipynb**: Full workflow including EDA, feature selection, scaling, regression (Linear, Ridge, Lasso), and model evaluation.
- **datasets/**: Contains CSV files used in the notebooks:
  - `Diabetes-Classification.csv`
  - `weather_data_extended.csv`

## Weather Dataset Columns

- Location
- Temperature (°C)
- Feels Like (°C)
- Humidity (%)
- Wind Speed (kph)
- Cloud Cover (%)
- Pressure (mb)
- UV Index
- Visibility (km)

## Main Features

- Data import and inspection using pandas
- Calculation of descriptive statistics (mean, min, max, etc.)
- Handling missing values
- Exploration of unique locations and their indices
- Visualizations: heatmaps, boxplots, scatter plots
- Feature selection and scaling (StandardScaler, RobustScaler)
- Regression modeling: Linear, Ridge, Lasso
- Model evaluation: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score
- Comparison of model performance

## Usage
